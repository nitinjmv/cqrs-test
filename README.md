Lets say we want implement the services to manage the Employee via CQRS pattern

EmployeeService

Commands {create, delete, update}
Query {retrieve}

===============Commands=====================
CommandController.java
Command endpoints > 
	/api/v1/employees
		POST	/create
		DELETE 	/delete/{id}
		PUT 	/update/{}
Models
	Employee
		Integer id autogenerated primary key
		String name 
		String email

Database: MySQL

================Query====================
QueryController.java
Query endpoints > 
	/api/v1/employees
		GET		/{id}
		GET		/
		
Document structure
{
	"id":"",
	"name":"",
	"email":""
}
Database: MongoDB


============== Flow =============
1. When DB is updated, webhook should trigger 
2. Webhook should read the database row > transform the data into document structure > push it as an event to kafka 
3. Consumer should subscribe the event > push it to mongoDB
